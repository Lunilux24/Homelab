# Homelab

This is the github repository for my Homelab. At the moment, I am running Ubuntu Server + Cockpit for remote monitoring and a frontend interface. I plan on using this repository to store important files such as docker-compose files, keep track of important links, plan future projects and document my progress and the things I learn along the way.
