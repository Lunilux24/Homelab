# Homelab
This is the github repository for my Homelab. At the moment, I am running Ubuntu Server + Cockpit for remote monitoring and a frontend interface. I plan on using this repository to store important files such as docker-compose files, keep track of important links, plan future projects and document my progress and the things I learn along the way.

## My Current Setup

- LENOVO 10RRS0B500 ThinkCentre M920q
- CPU: 6x Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-8500T CPU @ 2.10GHz
- Memory: 2x 16gb DDR4
- OS: Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS
- Drive 1: WD 1TB External HDD
- Drive 2: WD 3TB External HDD

## Applications

### Current Applications
  - Docker
  - Cockpit (Interface)
  - Tailscale
  - Jellyfin (Media Server)
  - Potainer.io (Container Manager)
  - Pi-hole (Network Monitor)
  - File Browser (File Server)
  - Immich (Image File Server)
  - Glance (Web Interface)
  - Karakeep (Bookmarker)

### What's Next?
When I first set out to create this homelab, it was to server two purposes. The first was to be a space for all my selfhosted applications. Using applications like Jellyfin and Immich were supposed to help me disconnect from big companies like Netflix and Google. I had a goal to remove myself from their platforms (to a reasonable extent) and not depend on them as much. At this current moment in time, I would like to say that I have mostly achieved that goal. Although there is still much to do in the background such as better organizing directories and compose files as well as eventually implementing Kubernetes, now that I have all my applications up and running, I will take a break and focus on the second goal. 

That second goal, which I seem to have forgotten about, is to make my own Bluehost service where I can truly self host my Mother's Wordpress website. Using Tailscale for my homelab meant that I didn't have to focus too much on the networking aspect of my server. Although this was convenient, it also felt like a work around to what I originally set out to do. For now, I plan on continuing to use Tailscale for my current applications, but in order to better understand networking and all it entails, I am going to begin the self hosting process for my Mother's Wordpress site. Not exactly sure what this entails or how long it will take, but just as before, I will update this repository to have every little detail regarding it's setup. Look forward to it!
