# File Server

The applications in this stack will include all file management or productivity related applications. The list includes:
    - Nextcloud
    - Immich
    - Docmost
    - Hoarder

This stack is intended to move a lot of my productivity and file storage apps to open source and free applications. Nextcloud will replace my Google Drive, Immich will replace my iCloud Photos, Docmost to replace my OneNote and Hoarder as a storage for all the important articles and guides I will inevitably come across during my Homelab journey.
