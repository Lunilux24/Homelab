# Jellyfin Media Server

This will be my 3rd iteration of the Jellyfin Media Server. The original version was running on Windows bare metal off of my gaming PC. I used an Apache web server as a reverse proxy and whitelist. 

As soon as I bought my server hardware, I migrated to Ubunutu desktop, but had issues with the web UI leading me to factory reset the PC and try it all again, but this time, on Ubuntu Server. 

I will run Jellyfin in its own container and keep it separate from everything else.
